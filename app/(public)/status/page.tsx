      {/* Pipeline-degraded note. The /api/status route gates this
          server-side and applies it to BOTH host and worker peers in
          a degraded cohort — when any member of the split_group is not
          `state="serving"`, every peer in the cohort is downgraded to
          loading + cleared loadedModels + `pipelineDegraded=true`. The
          two failure shapes we want to name explicitly here:

          1. Host is up, workers are still mmap'ing weights
             (`splitRole === "pipeline_host"`). Worth surfacing the
             worker count + pooled memory so the operator knows what
             they're waiting on.

          2. No host has been elected at all — every peer in the cohort
             is Worker / loading (`splitRole === "pipeline_worker"`).
             This is the May 13 split-brain mode: nothing is going to
             come up without operator intervention. Don't pretend a
             host exists; describe the deadlock honestly. */}

 *   - `everUseful`: true once we've observed this node in a state that
