/**
 * Curated catalog of models we know the Senda runtime can pull.
 *
 * Hand-maintained for now — once the runtime exposes a /v1/models/catalog
 * endpoint we can swap this out for a fetch. Keeping it client-side keeps
 * the Models page snappy even with no runtime online.
 *
 * ─── A note on memory accounting ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `minVramGb` is *usable GPU-allocatable memory*, not system RAM. It's
 * compared directly against the runtime's reported `vramGb`, which the
 * controller already pre-adjusts per backend:
 *
 *   • CUDA / ROCm: `vramGb` = the card's nameplate VRAM (e.g. an RTX
 *     3090 reports ~24 GB and you really do get 24 GB).
 *   • Metal (Apple Silicon): `vramGb` = the IOGPU wired-memory budget,
 *     which macOS caps at roughly 75 % of unified memory by default
 *     (`iogpu.wired_limit_mb`). So a 32 GB Mac reports ~24 GB, a 48 GB
 *     Mac reports ~36 GB, a 64 GB Mac reports ~48 GB, etc.
 *
 * That mapping is why human-readable descriptions below distinguish
 * "24 GB GPU" (CUDA card) from a "32 GB Mac" (system spec, ~24 GB
 * usable to Metal). Conflating the two is the most common way to
 * mislead a user about whether a model will actually fit, so when in
 * doubt, quote the *system-RAM* number for Macs (it's what users see
 * in About This Mac) and the *VRAM* number for discrete GPUs.
