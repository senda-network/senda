/**
 * Phase 4.A — model tiers.
 *
 * Three buckets the catalog + router treat differently:
 *
 *   - `daily_driver`  — models a single solo contributor can serve at a
 *                       chat-viable latency. The default chat model on
 *                       `senda.network` is always a `daily_driver` that
 *                       at least one peer is actively serving.
 *   - `capacity`      — large models (32B–70B class) that only fit on
 *                       beefy single peers or pooled split cohorts.
 *                       Routable on `/v1/models`, visible in the
 *                       catalog, but not chat-default. Through-mesh
 *                       latency is honestly slow in this tier; the UI
 *                       surfaces the expected TTFT/tok-s so the user
 *                       opts in with eyes open.
 *   - `experimental`  — anything new or uncategorised. Functional but
 *                       not promised.
 *
 * Tier is a static property of `(model family, parameter count)` — it
 * doesn't depend on which peer is currently serving the model. That's
 * why this lives in a plain lookup, not on the runtime status payload.
 *
 * Matching uses `normalizeModelId` (same helper the catalog uses) so a
 * runtime-reported id like `qwen3-8b-q4_k_m.gguf` matches the canonical
 * `Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M` row.
 *
 * Adding a new model: add a row to `TIER_BY_MODEL` below. If you
 * forget, `getModelTier` falls back to `experimental` and the catalog
 * renders it under the experimental section.
 */

/**
 * Per-tier latency expectations the routing SLA gate (Phase 4.B) reads,
 * and the catalog row uses for the "expected TTFT/tok-s" copy on the
 * capacity-tier expanded view.
 *
 * `target_ttft_ms_p50`  — request is routed to the mesh only when at
 *                          least one peer's measured TTFT p50 for this
 *                          model is below this number.
 * `target_tps_p50`       — same gate, for decode rate.
 * `min_native_ratio`     — through-mesh / native throughput floor.
 *                          Enforced in `evaluateSla`: a peer whose
 *                          measured through-mesh tok/s has degraded
 *                          below this fraction of its OWN native
 *                          baseline is demoted, so the entry routes
 *                          around it and the served through-mesh/native
 *                          ratio stays tight. Only applied when the peer
 *                          actually reports a native baseline (a solo
 *                          serve sits at ~1.0 by construction; pooled
 *                          splits and legacy peers have no baseline and
 *                          are never penalized). Until external supply
 *                          activates (Phase 5.E) a demotion changes only
 *                          the SLA verdict + bookkeeping, not what gets
 *                          served. Set a tier to 0 to disable the floor.
 *
 * Values are deliberately conservative for the daily-driver tier
 * (chat UX bar) and lenient for capacity (correctness over speed).
