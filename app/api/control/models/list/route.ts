/**
 * Lists every model that's been downloaded onto THIS node — not just the
 * ones currently held in VRAM. Calls `senda models installed` and
 * parses its decorated text output into `{ id, sizeBytes }` records.
 *
 * The CLI's `installed` output is grouped by model and looks roughly like:
 *
 *   💾 Installed models
 *   📁 HF cache: /Users/al/.cache/huggingface/hub
 *
 *   📦 Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M
 *      type: 🦙 GGUF
 *      size: 5.0GB 📏
 *      owner: mesh-managed
 *      …
 *
 *   📦 Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M
 *      …
 *
 * Earlier versions of this route called `senda models list`, which
 * doesn't exist as a subcommand and silently fell through to printing the
 * recommended-models catalog. The result was a Models page peppered with
 * "Custom model — not in our catalog" rows whose IDs were the first token
 * of each catalog header line ("•", "📚", "Qwen3", "Small", …). The new
 * subcommand and parser fix that.
