/**
 * Edge proxy (Next 16's middleware replacement). Its sole job is to make
 * absolutely sure that the public Vercel deployment (senda.network) does
 * not expose anything that's only meaningful on the user's own machine.
 *
 * The codebase has two surfaces that share components and libs:
 *   1. The public marketing + chat site, deployed to Vercel.
 *      `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT === "public"` here.
 *   2. The local controller bundled inside the desktop .app (and also
 *      installable via scripts/install-controller.sh on Linux servers).
 *      `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT` is unset there.
 *
 * The (control) route group — Dashboard, Chat-with-sidebar, Models, Mesh,
 * Activity, Settings — and every /api/control/* endpoint only make sense
 * on (2). Shipping them on (1) would mean the public website appears to
 * "manage your computer hardware", which is exactly the sort of confusion
 * we want to avoid. So on the public deployment we 404 every route in
 * that surface.
 *
 * Belt-and-braces: the route handlers themselves *also* check `isPublic`
 * and refuse to do anything dangerous. Middleware just makes the routes
 * cease to exist at the edge before any handler runs.
